The chatbot that you're using does not store any personal data. It is simply part of a machine learning project that I am doing for fun. The basic idea is that the chatbot is trained on my social media conversations, and should hopefully respond to messages the way that I do. 

There's no storing of personal information, no ads that will be sent to you, no promotional content, no selling of services, and no requesting of financial information.
